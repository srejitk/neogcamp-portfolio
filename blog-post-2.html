        <p class="blog-desc">
          The Idea of coding can get really intimidating especially with the way
          it's shown in the movies but an hour scoring through YT and a few
          weeks effort and everyone can understand the beautiful world of
          coding.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-desc">
          And that is mainly thanks to the abundant amount of resources which
          learner have access to, from beginners to experts there's always room
          for everyone, but this abundance comes with a curse.

        <p class="blog-desc">
          The Tutorial Hell!! It's easy to binge the learn to code videos in one
          go and think that you know everything, the truth couldn't be any
          further from it.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-desc">
          The best way to learn to code is to , you guessed it, code.
          Consistently. Persistently. It'll be hard, trust me, I face the
          struggle. But showing up everyday will only make you better.
